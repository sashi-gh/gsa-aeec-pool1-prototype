        <h2>Adverse drug event reports since 2004</h2>

        <p>This is the openFDA API endpoint for adverse drug events. An adverse event is submitted to the FDA to report
            any
            undesirable experience associated with the use of a drug, including serious drug side effects, product use
            errors,
            product quality problems, and therapeutic failures.</p>

        <p>Reporting of adverse events by healthcare professionals and consumers is voluntary in the United States.
            Increases in the total number of adverse events are likely caused by improved reporting. News, enforcement
            actions, and other phenomena can also spur reporting.</p>
