### 1) Pool One Design Prototype URL:  http://americanconsultants.github.io/gsa-prototype/

### 2) Development process

Our approach is based on process (Scrum/ 1 Week Sprints), people (multi-disciplinary team) and technology (open source and new web technology that meets the needs). We adopted Scrum because the requirements were not well defined in the start of the project. We have designated Darwin Layog as a user of the proposed system (product Owner).The customer includes the Product Owner and other stakeholders from the customer side.

Please refer to the folder **"docs"** for supporting documentation.

### 3) The Team *[RFQ 24.0 Evaluation Factors (b)]*

Our multi-disciplinary and self-organizing team consisting of: 

**3.1. Vamsi Kulukuru** (Category 1:Product Manager): Scrum Master , team facilitator, responsible for overall quality of the prototype project. ***[RFQ 24.0 Evaluation Factors (a)]***

**3.2. Sashi Nareddi** (Category 5: Visual Designer). Primary Skills: Style Guide, Wire Frames (mock-ups)

**3.3. Pallav Bora** (Category 3: Interaction designer/User Researcher/Usability tester). Primary skills: requirements gathering using user centric approaches, testing.

**3.4. Girish Showkatramani** (Category 6: From End Developer). Primary skills: Web Technologies including Angular JS, D3, CSS3, HTML5.



### 4) Inclusion of People *[RFQ 24.0 Evaluation Factors (c)]*

As part of Scrum process we have worked closely with Darwin Layog (Product Owner). We created a Product Backlog (high level requirements) by working collaboratively with the Product Owner. we have had Sprint Planning meetings before the start of the Sprints where we work withthe Product Owner and decompose the backlog items into finer requirements. At the end of each Sprint we have had Sprint Review in the presence of the
Product Owner where we gave a live demonstration of the work completed in the previous Sprint and obtained his feedback

### 5) Human Centered Design *[RFQ 24.0 Evaluation Factors (d)]*

Wireframes (mockups) of the prototype were created and they were finalized after reviewing by a cross section of users including the Product Owner, in addition to taking into consideration Section 508 Compliance. The following aspects of HCD were considered:

**Visibility:** The color combination (in addition to being Section 508 compliant) and screen layout were finalized after obtaining feedback from users on the wireframes (mockups).  

**Accessibility:** The page controls were determined based on user preference. “Chunking” was applied to present information in different categories so that an user can intuitively retrieve the information he/she is looking for.

**Language:** The language of the web page content was decided based on user preferences so that the user can easily identify the prototype with his day to day work.

### 6) Use of a Style Guide *[RFQ 24.0 Evaluation Factors (e)]*

We followed USPTO User Interface (UI) Design Library for creating the UI components. ( https://uspto.github.io/designpatterns/ )

### 7) Modern Web Technologies *[RFQ 24.0 Evaluation Factors (f)]*

Based on ability to meet the requirements and mutual compatibility we have selected the following modern web technologies: Yeoman, Angular JS , HTML 5, D3 and Bootstrap.
These technologies have been widely adopted by the industry and have active community involvement and support.

### 8) Usability Testing *[RFQ 24.0 Evaluation Factors (g)]* 

We made usability testing a mandatory component of every sprint. A wireframe (mockup) was created for each Story and was reviewed by the user for usability before development began. 

### 9) Use of an Iterative Approach *[RFQ 24.0 Evaluation Factors (h)]*

We used Scrum (am agile methodology) where each Sprint (2 weeks iteration) was followed by a Sprint Review. The stories development in a particular Sprint are demonstrated to the user and feedback solicited. There was also an Sprint Retrospective session where the team did a post-mortem of the previous Sprint. User feedback from the Sprint Reviews and team learnings from the Sprint Retrospective fed into the next Sprint. Based on user feedback from the Sprint reviews significant changes were assigned to new stories and added to the backlog.   

### 10) Multiple Device and Responsive Design *[RFQ 24.0 Evaluation Factors (i)]*

We have used Bootstrap v3.3.5 framework to achieve responsive behavior.

### 11) Run the Prototype on another Machine *[RFQ 24.0 Evaluation Factors (j)]*
```
	*Clone the github repository using gitclone from command line
	(Command: git clone https://github.com/AmericanConsultants/gsa-prototype.git)
	
  
   *Run npm install && bower install
   
	*Run command grunt for building and grunt –serve to preview the application.
```
### 12) Openly Licensed and Free Platform *[RFQ 24.0 Evaluation Factors (k)]*

The technologies used (please refer to **“7) Modern Web Technologies”** above ) are Open Source and Free of Charge.
